## Project Structure Overview

NetHawk has a modular architecture. For a detailed overview of the project structure, please refer to the [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) file.

Key directories include:

*   `nethawk/cli/`: CLI entrypoints and user interface
*   `nethawk/core/`: Core runtime, async logic, config, execution
*   `nethawk/data/`: Config files and profile definitions
*   `nethawk/libs/`: Internal libraries used by services
*   `nethawk/services/`: Protocol-specific service modules
*   `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
*   `docs/`: Documentation

## Adding New Features

If you're looking to add new functionality, here are some common areas:

*   **Add a New Protocol:** Create a new folder in `services/` and define a service class. See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for details.
*   **Add a New HTTP Module:** Drop your script into `services/http/` and ensure it has a `run(self, target)` method. See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for details.
*   **Add Internal Logic:** Contribute to the relevant directory within `libs/` (e.g., `libs/domain_resolver/`). See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for details.
